"""Tools for reading a Web scrapings file.

At the outer level, a Web scrapings file is a sequence of sentences (each of
which may contain multiple human language sentences.

Each sentence can be thought of as a dictionary, with properties such as:

    text: a single string of text
    allTokens: a sequence of strings
    annotationSet: a set of properties resulting from manual annotation of the sentence
    uri

There are several classes provided in this file to read sentences in a variety
of external formats.  Some of these formats might not provide a full set of
properties for each sentence. Of the properties listed above, only "allTokens"
and "uri" are are required by the applyCrf code.

This code is not terribly pythonic.
